# DesignPatterns

The aim of this repository is to practice design patterns examples. It consists of a simple Animal-Guardian-Tutor system which both Guardian and Tutor have some functions in common related to commands they can teach or request to the pets. 
Also, the base for the code was inspired by the Udemy course provided by HCode Treinamentos: Design Patterns com Java - Entendendo Padr√µes de Projetos
